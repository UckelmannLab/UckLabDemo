## Open Lab

Open Lab makes study hosting easy and provides a secure foundation for data collection. The application has an open source code on GitHub and runs online at https://open-lab.online. Open Lab has a direct integration with the lab.js experiment builder at https://lab.js.org, which allows designing and building an experiment in a web browser. The purpose of Open Lab is not to design an experiment, but to deploy it online in the most efficient way, focusing on data security, performance and user experience.
