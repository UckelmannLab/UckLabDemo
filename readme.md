## Open Lab

Open Lab makes lab.js study hosting easy and provides a secure foundation for data collection. The application has an open source code on GitHub and runs online at https://open-lab.online. Open Lab has a direct integration with the lab.js experiment builder at https://lab.js.org, which allows designing and building an experiment in a web browser. The purpose of Open Lab is not to design an experiment, but to deploy it online in the most efficient way, focusing on data security, performance and user experience.

## Features

* Hosting your study created in lab.js: There is no need to set up your own server: you can use existing templates or upload a study from lab.js with just one click.
* Data security: HTTPS, user authentication system, personal invitations
* Participant management system: Track data collection in real time
* Collaboration with colleagues: Share studies and tasks
* Data protection compliance: Check our [Terms & Conditions](https://open-lab.online/docs/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://open-lab.online/docs/policy).

## Researcher access in a web browser

As a researcher, you can create and manage your study in a web browser at https://open-lab.online. After creating the study, you send an invitation link to participants. Please see the documentation for researchers [here](https://open-lab.online/docs/intro).

## Setting up your own Open Lab server (for developers)

Clone the repository to your local folder and run `npm install`

The application depends on the environment variables (such as the database address), which you can specify in the file variables.env in the root folder.
Please contact us at info@open-lab.online if you want to deploy it on your server.
